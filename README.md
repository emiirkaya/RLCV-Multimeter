# RLCV-Multimeter :
Multimeter PCB embedded on Arduino Uno R3 that measures R, L, C, voltage and current ✨.
 ## Key features 🗝️
 + Compact 70x70mm 2-Layer Multimeter PCB design with bottom lane as GND
 + The old Arduino Uno R3 as the main microcontroller
 + 16x2 LCD Uno R3 shield for monitoring measurements
 + Tactile button to switch measurement modes 
 + Uses DEMUX and Quad line drivers for switching desired sensing circuitry
 + 2 External ADC ADS1015IDGST chips to only read voltages
 + ACS712 to measure current up to 5A
 + LCD and Arduino will be mounted on the drilled holes of the PCB 

Code Coming Soon...
